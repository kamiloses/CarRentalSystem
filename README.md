Simple API Microservices Synchronous App

Initially, I had many more ideas for this project, but I eventually decided to stop working on it to focus on building an asynchronous microservices app, which should be much more interesting.

Libraries/Frameworks Used:

- API Gateway
- OpenFeign
- Eureka Client & Server
- Spring Security
- Spring Web
- Hibernate
- MySQL
